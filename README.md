2. Create a database schema (i.e. Entity Relationship Diagram) that shows your database structure. 
3. Document each section of your c# scripts with comments. You do not need to document every single line. 
4. Build a minimum of 4 pages that contain the functionality you need:
  1. use .net server controls for any form inputs or data displays
  2. employ proper validation using .net validation controls
  3. use a master page that includes a global navigation bar and basic css
  4. Create / Read / Update and Delete functionality
5. Build a register page so I can create an account for myself  
6. Build a login page so I can log in to the site
7. All pages besides your home page, register, and login must be secured using ASP.NET Identity or Forms Authentication and your database 
8. All CRUD operations must use Entity Framework. You cannot use the SqlDataSource control.
